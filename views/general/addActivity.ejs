        We're currently building this feature to allow people to add activites to the Sociable Life map, but it's not quite ready yet.
        If you'd like to be part of the early access and help us test out this feature <a href="/contact">please contact us</a> 👍
    </p>
        
    <p>
        You've already done all the hard work by finding or organising events, so we're committed to keeping adding activities FREE.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Activities are updated by our community of supporters. Old events are removed automatically, so you know if it's on the map it's up to date!
        This means you (or someone from the community) will need to update the activity listing every 6 months to confirm the information is still current.
