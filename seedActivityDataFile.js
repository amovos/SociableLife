Our diverse range of activities are led by qualified and experienced staff in small supported groups.  One of our activities aimed to promote the learning of new skills and abilities is our bike workshop which runs Monday to Thursday. One of our own staff members Len runs this for the students with the aim to teach new and practical skills.  After the clients and staff fix the donated bikes we then put them out the front of Camtrust to sell and raise money for the charity. All of our clients thoroughly enjoy going to the bike workshop to learn how to fix the bikes and having an active part in helping the fundraising for Camtrust.",

    "description": "Music Mondays is a project for teenagers aged 10-18 years with mild to moderate learning disabilities to access music and to help make new friends. Staffing support comprises a group leader, 4 supporting staff, a volunteer and a music technician. The majority of the staff team have music skills to share with the young people. All our staff are experienced in working with people with inclusive needs. So far the teenagers have had the opportunity to play instruments, learn DJ skills, write their own songs and also had the chance to sing their favourite songs. The group size is small (7-9 young people) to ensure the young people have sufficient input from each support worker to make the sessions fulfilling and beneficial. Parents and carers are responsible for getting their child/young person to and from the venue as LWCA do not have transport facilities. Places are allocated through a self-referral system. The application form is available as a download on their website. Alternatively a social worker/lead professional may also make an application on your behalf.",

It’s all part of a project called Chased Active Friday that’s been pioneered by Inspiring healthy lifestyles (Ihl) in Cannock Chase over the past three years.

This site include a number of challenging play elements, such as a large space net, arieal swing and multiplay units which are located within a large sand play area.",
